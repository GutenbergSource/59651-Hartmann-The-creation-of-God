<HTML><BODY>This 1893 book is a long treatise against the superstitions of religion, and the scientific answers that can replace them. Of course, the science is outdated. However, any progress in the last 125 years has only made the argument more compelling -- although maybe not compelling enough, because what the good author should have been arguing against is not as much an outdated scientific vision of the world, or even failed mode of reasoning, but a social and political system of organizing society of which those things are only a small part of the package deal called "religion".

<p>Anyway, a long treatise to show that most of the arguments against religion are already very old, and have had limited force in convincing those inside it, and for the same reasons will probably have limited success today.

<p>No particular difficulties expected. Some chemical formulas using subscripts (use underscores for subscripts like so: H_{2}O).

<p>Have fun!</BODY></HTML>
